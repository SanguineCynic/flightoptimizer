### About the Project

This project aims to address the challenges faced by current air traffic control (ATC) management systems through the integration of predictive analytics and advanced technological solutions. By leveraging tools such as Aviationstack for real-time and historical flight data, Google Colab for machine learning model development, and Keras with TensorFlow for neural network training, we seek to enhance the predictability of potential disruptions and optimize flight routes. Moreover, we prioritize environmental sustainability by incorporating Open Access Geospatial Data in Europe (OAG) to assess the environmental impact of air traffic and optimize flight paths accordingly. Through collaborative efforts and innovative approaches, this project endeavors to revolutionize air traffic control management for a more efficient and sustainable future.
